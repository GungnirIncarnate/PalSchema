[Dummy Blueprints](https://github.com/PalworldModding/UsefulFiles/blob/master/DummyBlueprints.zip) - When creating new game content with the Palworld Modding Kit, I recommend grabbing a copy of dummy blueprints which contains skeletons of almost all of the game's blueprints that can be referenced when creating new items, pals, etc.
