When creating new game content with the Palworld Modding Kit, I recommend grabbing a copy of dummy blueprints which contains skeletons of almost all of the game's blueprints that can be referenced when creating new items, pals, etc.

`Pal` folder inside the zip goes into the `Content` folder of your Palworld Modding Kit install.
