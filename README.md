# PalSchema
PalSchema is a mod that allows modifying of data tables in Palworld with json files without introducing conflicts with other mods that modify the same data table. As the name suggests, I've also made heavy use of json schema, so mod creators can have autocompletion and error checking to make creation of table mods easier.

# Installation
1. First, you need to download this specific experimental version of [UE4SS](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/releases/download/experimental/UE4SS_v3.0.1-253-g154f502.zip). It might work on the latest experimental version, but just to avoid compatibility issues, get the one linked here.

2. Next you want to get the latest release version of [PalSchema](https://github.com/Okaetsu/PalSchema/releases) and you'll want to choose either the normal or developer version based on what your use case is. If you plan on creating mods for PalSchema then download PalSchema_x.x.x-beta_Dev.zip, otherwise, just download PalSchema_x.x.x-beta.zip.

3. After you're done downloading PalSchema, you'll want to move the PalSchema folder inside of the zip to the Mods folder in either Pal/Binaries/Win64/ue4ss (Steam) or Pal/Binaries/WinGDK/ue4ss (Game Pass).

4. Done! Any mods created for PalSchema go inside the PalSchema/mods folder.
